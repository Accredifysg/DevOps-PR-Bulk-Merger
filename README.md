## Setup

### GitHub Token Setup

Create a "Personal access token", with at least the `repo/public_repo`
scope. Add your token with repo access to `.env`:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<yourtoken>
```

The scripts will use this token to talk to GitHub.

### Ruby setup

Install Ruby using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf). This project is using Ruby 3.3.6 (from .ruby-version).

```
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf install ruby 3.3.6
asdf global ruby 3.3.6
```

After that, install the dependency of this project. If you dont have budler yet, install it with `gem install bundler`. `gem` should be installed already when you install ruby via asdf.
```
bundle install
```

## Bulk approve PRs

```

## Approve & merge all Pull Requests

```
./merge "bump hashicorp/aws"
```

This will run the `./review` script above, and also merge the approved PRs. I added a 10 second delay between merges to throttle merge process. There could be multiple dependabot PRs within one project, and it need time to sync between main branches and.


```sh
Proceed with caution. If you are unsure about any part of this process, consult with your team.
